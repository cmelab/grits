GRiTS works by using [SMILES](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html) strings to find instances of that chemical fragment and map those atom indices to a bead. The goal of this example is to map the backbone of each ITIC molecule and the thiophene ring in each P3HT monomer (the GSD file contains a 16-mer) to a bead.\n",

The SMILES patterns for these beads are chosen carefully such that they are exclusive: The thiophene moiety used to map P3HT also exists in ITIC, but because the `itic_backbone` pattern we have chosen uses up the atoms in the thiophenes and this pattern is first in the `beads` dictionary, only the `itic_backbone` pattern will match in ITIC.\n",
